##  Description
Thanks to Ray Villalobos I am far more familiar with Git, Node.js, and GitHub setup. I am also able to create my first controller, connect a Firebase database, and read, push, and delete data from that database. I can use Firebase's simpleLogin service, so that I can log users in and out and pass registration data back and forth from the app. With a few finishing touches, like custom directives, I now have an Angular app will be ready to publish.

## Topics include:
- Installing Git and Node.js on Mac
- Installing AngularJS and its models
- Creating modules and routes
- Working with controllers
- Connecting to Firebase data
- Adding user registration
- Searching, filtering, and deleting records
- Creating custom directives

## Instructions
 You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at.

1. Make sure you have these installed
	- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
	- [git](http://git-scm.com/)
 	- [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (mac) or Gitbash (PC) `> git clone https://github.com/ahlusar1989/angulardata.git`
3. CD to the folder `cd angulardata`
4. Run `> npm install` to install the project dependencies
